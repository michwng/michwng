/**
 * The modified version of this audioplayer removes
 * static references and alters the constructor.
 * Many methods were removed since they did not function correctly.
 * 
 * Note: Audio Files are pulled from the same folder as Semester Project.
 * Most files have been compressed in .wav format so the size is roughly 40.5 MB.
 * 
 * Music Files are pulled from a multitude of video games/movies.
 * None of these soundtracks are made or owned by Michael Ng.
 * 
 * Soundtracks originate from:
 * Fate Grand Order -First Order-: Eaving Time (Ending), KYRIELIGHT (Preparations), Scalavera (Battle), The Shield of Chaldeas (Battle 2). 
 * Fate/Zero: Grief (Defeat). 
 * Fire Emblem Fates: Get Item, Level Up. 
 * Overwatch: Victory. 
 * Valkyria Chronicles: Main Theme (Main Menu) Europa at War (Ambience), The Gallian War (AfterMap).
 * Valkyria Chronicles 2: Briefing.
 * Fire Emblem Three Houses: Fodlan Winds (Rain), Fodlan Winds (Thunder), Indomitable Will Rain (Final Boss)
